# Final Project Overview

## Welcome to Srujan Avirneni's Final Project

This is a small book to give you a feel for the final project I worked on.

# Project Overview

Welcome to the comprehensive overview of my Machine Learning project. In this Jupyter Book, you can navigate through all the resources including the resume, code base, experiments, container, deployed model, and a Streamlit application. Additionally, a video walkthrough is embedded for a guided tour of the project.
